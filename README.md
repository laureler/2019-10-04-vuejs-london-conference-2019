# 2019-10-14 Vue.js London Conference 2019

This repo contains code used at the Vue.js London Conference. The
live-coding talk I gave was about building
[https://keyboard-keyboard.ycmjason.com](https://keyboard-keyboard.ycmjason.com) 
from close to scratch.

The live-coding talk mainly focus on showcasing the possibility of [Vue
3's Composition API](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/78) using the
Vue 2 plugin
[@vue/composition-api](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api).
